MODULE NOT FOUND/CANNOT IMPORT
check you've pip installed all the requirements
check for misspellings especially capitals and plurals (or get Alex to check she's super good at it). Make your SQL
tables singular to start with - avoid plurals

SERVICE.PY NOT RECOGNISED/LINKING
doesn't get recognised via application move it from the application folder to the main folder (where
requirements and app are) do not pip install service! (it said on the internet to do this, it's something else and
 it meant I had to start a new project because it kept looking for things to do with the service library/framework). If you
 need to move the service file, or any file, I would recommend just making a new file and copy and pasting the contents
 into it because Pycharm doesn't like linking it otherwise)

TABLE UNKNOWN
mispelling/not using the exact SQL table names in Python
